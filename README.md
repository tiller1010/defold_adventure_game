# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "empty" project template.

The settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) are all the default. A bootstrap empty ["main.collection"](defold://open?path=/main/main.collection) is included.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
